BRAIN CPU <-> MOTCON CPU SPI COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION


16-bit data width
7.5MHz

6 bits cmd  10 bit data

Commands:

1 NOP
11 SPEED_FORWARD  0 = stop, 1023 = max speed
12 SPEED_BACKWARD 0 = stop, 1023 = max speed
13 CURR_LIMIT     0 = stop, 1023 = max current limit



Reports:

6 bits header 10 bit data

1  REPORT1   data=latest current C
2  REPORT2   data=latest current B




Next revision would be:

SPI packets are delimited by utilizing the nCS.

Data width is still 16-bits, and f still 7.5MHz.

There are no headers, so all 16 bits can be utilized.

Data frame:

brain -> motcon
uint16	state
	bit15	must always be written 0
	bit0..2 mode
	0 = sleep (least power) (not implemented yet)
	1 = disable drive. Robot can freewheel.
	2 = short brake.
	3 = DC brake low level
	4 = DC brake high level
	5 = Drive enabled
	6 = Reserved
	7 = Reserved
int16	max speed
int16	max torque
int16	res
int16	res
int16	res
int16	res
uint16	CRC (to be done later)

motcon -> brain
uint16	status
	bit0	drive enabled
int16	speed
int16	current
int16	position (free-running count)
int16	res
int16	res
int16	res
uint16	CRC (to be done later)


brain -> motcon
special data frame for entering flasher:
0xfaaa
0x1234
0xabcd
0x420b
0xacdc
0xabba
0x1337
0xacab
SPI is reconfigured with separate flasher protocol.
